Dr. Katherine Drotos enjoys when evolution repeats itself (or seems to!). As a current Food From Thought Postdoctoral scholar, she focuses in two areas: 1) comparing clustering algorithms used in interspecific hybridization systems to examine ancestry proportions, and 2) if agriculture has played a role in the history of hybridization in leuciscid minnows. In her PhD, Katherine investigated the genome sizes of multiple lineages of lichen-forming fungi, and uncovered a mis-citation of global lichen coverage that had spread through the literature. Outside of work, Katherine likes to hang out with her dog and horses, draw, and spend time in nature.
