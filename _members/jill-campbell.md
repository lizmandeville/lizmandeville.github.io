Jill completed a MSc in Integrative Biology in the Mandeville Lab in 2023 and is currently employed at the State Museum of Natural History in Stuttgart, Germany.

Jillian completed her BSc with a major in Biology at Queenâ€™s University. For her MSc in Integrative Biology at the University of Guelph, Jillian used genomic analyses to determine the effectiveness of a fisheries management intervention at reducing the incidence of hybridization between native and non-native Catostomus suckers. Determining the effectiveness of such operations helps to establish stronger management and conservation approaches in the future. This work involved extensive collaboration with Colorado Parks and Wildlife.
