Cassandre completed her BSc at Queenâ€™s University with a major in Biology and a minor in Computing. Following this, Cassandre completed her MSc in the Mandeville lab, where she used bioinformatic and computational tools to investigate evolutionary processes. Specifically, she focused on determining the genetic basis of sex determination in Catostomus suckers using genomic data as well as bioinformatic tools such as a genome wide association study. Cassandre started her PhD at the University of Toronto in the fall of 2022. She is working with Dr. Steven Wright and continuing her research on sex determination and the evolution of sex chromosome systems.
