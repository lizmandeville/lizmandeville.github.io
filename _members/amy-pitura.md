Amy was a graduate student in the Mandeville lab at the University of Guelph from 2021-2024. She graduated from UoG in 2024 with a MSc in Bioinformatics. Prior to her work as a graduate student in the lab, Amy worked as an undergraduate researcher from 2020-2021. 

For her MSc in Bioinformatics, Amy focused on using modelling software to recreate the demographic history of minnow populations in southern Ontario. She examined how changes in population dynamics align with human activity, such as European colonization and the intensification of land use during the Industrial revolution. 

Amy is also interested in applying machine learning to biodiversity questions: she is part of the machine learning to identify trout hybrids project and is also working on collecting underwater footage for a future biomonitoring project. She completed her BSc in Marine and Freshwater Biology at the University of Guelph.
