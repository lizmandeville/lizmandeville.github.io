Dr. Mandeville is currently an Assistant Professor at Northern Michigan University and is also an Adjunct Professor at University of Guelph. (She ran a previous iteration of the Mandeville Lab at the University of Guelph from 2019-2023.) Work in her lab focuses on quantifying and explaining variation in evolutionary processes using high resolution genomic data. Most of her work focuses on freshwater fish facing anthropogenic disturbances, and she often collaborates with conservation and management agencies. She also enjoys learning and teaching new computational approaches and programming languages, and is interested in effective visualization of multidimensional scientific data.

Liz completed her BS in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Yale University, followed by a PhD and postdoctoral research at the University of Wyoming.
