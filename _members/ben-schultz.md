Dr. Ben Schultz was a PhD student in the lab at the University of Guelph from 2020 to 2024. He is currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Maryland. 

For his PhD in the Department of Integrative Biology, Ben focused on genomic analysis of <i>Chrosomus</i> dace populations, specifically on the hybridization of <i>Chrosomus eos</i> and <i>C. neogaeus</i> and the parental and hybrid sex determination mechanisms. He also sequenced the first ever reference genome for the northern redbelly dace!

Prior to his work in our lab at Guelph, Ben completed a MASc in Environmental Applied Science and Management at Ryerson University, where he focused on parasite ecology, specifically regarding freshwater invertebrates. Benâ€™s interests include freshwater ecology, parasitology, and more recently, genomics.
