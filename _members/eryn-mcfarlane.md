Dr. McFarlane was a visiting researcher with the Mandeville Lab from 2020-2023, and is currently an Assistant Professor at York University in Toronto. She is an ongoing "Friend of the Lab" and frequent collaborator. 

Eryn McFarlane is an evolutionary ecologist who works on anthropogenic hybridization, using both the genetics of wild animals (most recently hybridizing deer in Scotland) and slightly less wild computer simulations for theoretical work. She’s completed work as part of the Modelscape Project with Alex Buerkle at University of Wyoming, after having done a Swedish Research Council Postdoctoral Fellow at University of Edinburgh with Josephine Pemberton. Previously, Eryn did her PhD on the hybridization and physiology of collared and pied flycatchers with Anna Qvarnström at Uppsala University and her MSc and BSc at University of Guelph with Andrew McAdam on North American red squirrels.
