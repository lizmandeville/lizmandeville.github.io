## Master's position for fall 2026

The Mandeville Lab at Northern Michigan University is recruiting a MS student to work on the evolutionary genomics of freshwater fish (start date fall 2026). 

Research in our lab focuses on how evolutionary processes shape freshwater fish biodiversity. Specific project topic will depend on the interests of the successful candidate, but possible focus areas include hybridization, effects of anthropogenic disturbance, population connectivity, and the evolution of fish sex determination mechanisms. We work on many different groups of freshwater fish, including but not limited to suckers, whitefish, dace, and leuciscid minnows.

Candidates interested in evolution, fish biology, ecology, genetics, conservation, or related fields are encouraged to apply. Desired qualifications include strong writing skills, excellent critical thinking, and the ability to balance working independently and collaboratively. All projects will involve analysis of high resolution genomic data, requiring computational approaches and high performance computing. No prior computational experience is required, but all applicants must be enthusiastic about building their computational skills. The Mandeville Lab is an inclusive environment that supports researchers with diverse identities, and encourages applications from students who are members of historically excluded or marginalized groups.   

NMU is located in Marquette, Michigan, in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Marquette is a small but vibrant city on the southern shore of Lake Superior, located close to beautiful natural areas. It's a great place to live and work, and the proximity to many of our field sites enables us to do satisfying work integrating ecological and evolutionary questions. 

To apply, please send a letter of interest, CV, transcript (unofficial is fine), and contact information for three references to Dr. Liz Mandeville, lmandevi@nmu.edu. Review of applications will begin immediately, and will continue until a suitable candidate is identified. Please apply by December 15, 2025 for full consideration.
