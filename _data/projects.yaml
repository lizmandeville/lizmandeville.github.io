  description: All-female, asexually reproducing populations of dace can be found across the US and Canada. It is believed that these lineages originated from hybridization events between <i>Chrosomus eos</i> and <i>C. neogaeus</i> in a glacial refugium approximately 50,000 years ago, but the origins of these lineages are still poorly understood. Our work in this system in Ontario (led by Dr. Ben Schultz) uncovered unexpected evidence of contemporary hybridization and ongoing production of backcrossed hybrids, reshaping our understanding of the evolutionary history of these species and hybrid lineages. We aim to identify the history of hybridization and any potential backcrossing, as well as comparing sex determination mechanisms in parental lineages to identify potential incompatibilities.
